Batch scripts to clear up disk space and potentially makes windows run faster on your PC

## The Idea
Batch scripts are efficent in a sense, run them with a click of your mouse instead of typing out commands on Windows CLI.

Look ugly doesn't it? Dust is the greatest enemy just as high temperature is the greatest enemy to CPU and GPU.

2) Run antivirus software (e.g Malwarebytes, alledgedly it is spyware). Suit yourself on the choices of antivirus software.

3) Disable run on startup for installed application that you don't need (Most generic applications will not run into problems when disabled)

4) Avoid running multiple applications unless required (esp gaming and lag)

**Not an expert, just general advice, suit yourself in anyway you want.
